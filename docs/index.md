The [Advanced Biomedical Computational Science (ABCS)](https://frederick.cancer.gov/research/bioinformatics-and-computational-science/advanced-biomedical-computational-science) group, part of the Bioinformatics and Computational Science (BACS) directorate at [Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR)](https://frederick.cancer.gov/), offers a wide range of services to support scientific projects for the [National Cancer Institute (NCI)](https://www.cancer.gov/) and [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) scientists and staff.

ABCS specializes in bioinformatics, mathematical simulation and modeling, image analysis and visualization, text mining, proteomic analysis, data integration, database maintenance and development, as well as scientific web application development.

ABCS plays a crucial role in advancing research efforts by applying computational and data science, and artificial intelligence to problems in cancer, infectious disease, immunology, rare disease, HIV and other specialized biomedical research areas at the NCI and NIH.
